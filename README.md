# Kickstarter

## Goal

Course project for "Data Mining" university course.

## Data

- [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsajanbhagat/kickstarter)

## Plan of Attack

- [X] Load data.
- [X] Data audit and information value analysis.
- [X] Feature Engineer: use date columns to make durations (in load data notebook).
- [X] Finish univariate analysis.
- [X] PyCaret without text features.
- [X] Move missing value handling to first notebook.
- [X] Restructure code.
- [ ] Text preprocessing: stopwords removal.
- [ ] Text preprocessing: convert numbers to their word equivalent.
- [ ] Text preprocessing: leave only words.
- [ ] Text preprocessing: stemming.
- [ ] Text preprocessing: lemmatization.
- [ ] Construct a tf-idf matrix.
- [ ] Use Glove word embeddings.
- [ ] Try out an RNN with tf-idf matrix.
- [ ] Try out an RNN with Glove word embeddings.
